		<p class="clr-white">Improvements since the first ranking in 2016 are encouraging and suggest that leaders will continue to show the way, driving sustainability in the sector. Positive outcomes include:</p>
		<ul class="checklist clr-white">
			<li>More companies with policies and commitments;</li>
			<li>More companies using more sustainable cotton; and</li>
			<li>Increased overall uptake of more sustainable cotton.</li>

		<h4 class="title txt-center">... but thereâ€™s still much to do</h4>
		<p class="txt-center gap-50px">While significant positive progress is visible, there is still much to do:</p>
		<ul class="row row-30 checklist chck-cross">
			<li class="col-xs-6">Only around half of all assessed companies have a policy on cotton sustainability;</li>
			<li class="col-xs-6">Only 11 companies have time-bound commitments or targets for greater use of more sustainable cotton; and</li>
			<li class="col-xs-6">Company performance on uptake and traceability is considerably lower than on policy, even among leaders;</li>
			<li class="col-xs-6">Uptake of more sustainable cotton remains relatively low with most of the heavy lifting done by a handful of leaders.</li>

			<div class="item">Better performing companies have policies on more sustainable cotton and sourcing targets.</div>	
			<div class="item">Leaders take responsibility for sustainability across their whole cotton supply chain and actively support supply chain partners in making improvements.</div>	
			<div class="item">Many companies refer to their membership of standards organisations or sustainability initiatives as a proxy for policy. Leaders go further, developing their own policies,  acknowledging the issues, and clearly expressing their intent to improve performance on all of the cotton they use.</div>	
			<div class="item">Relatively few companies have policies on pesticides, water, biodiversity, human rights, and recycling. For all companies, there is still work to be done.</div>

		<div class="chck-green row">
			<div class="item">Leaders perform better than the rest in all areas but the difference is most marked in the area of uptake. A few leaders have relatively high scores, followed by a few with successively lower scores, while most companies score nothing at all.</div>	
			<div class="item">Companies with high levels of more sustainable cotton use also scored highly on policy and traceability. They are more likely to have published clear policies and provided insight into their supply chains.</div>

			<div class="item">Leaders are more transparent this year than last year, but even they have work to do.</div>	
			<div class="item">Transparency and accountability to stakeholders on volumes of cotton used are essential for a sustainable cotton sector but few companies report volumes of all cotton lint used.</div>
