			<p>The number of companies selected for assessment in 2017 has increased compared to 2016. Company selection was made according to sector indices and benchmarks, as well as lists of top companies in the fashion and garment sector and their respective markets. </p>
			<p>Special attention was given to the inclusion of companies from key emerging markets in India, Brazil, South Africa and China because mainstreaming more sustainable cotton will require most of the largest companies in every major consumer market to commit to its sourcing.</p>

		<h4 class="title txt-center">The questionnaire</h4>
		<p class="txt-center">The questionnaire is the backbone of the company assessment and covers three areas:</p>
		<div class="row row-30">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<h6><i class="policy"></i>policy</h6>
				<p>Sustainability policies provide a company with a vital foundation and direction for business operations when it comes to sourcing more sustainable cotton.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<h6><i class="uptake"></i>uptake</h6>
				<p>To reflect the fact that only sourcing can deliver change, the assessment prioritises actual uptake of sustainable cotton (55 points out of 100).</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row row-30">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<h6><i class="traceability"></i>Traceability</h6>
				<p>Companies must pay attention to the origin of their cotton, who their suppliers are, and how much cotton passes through their supply chain to be able to act.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<div class="block">
					<div class="content">
						<p>While the structure of the questionnaire used in 2017 and the proportion of points allocated to policy (20 points), uptake (55 points) and traceability (25 points) is similar to that used in 2016, a few changes were introduced. For more information on these changes, please read the full report.</p>
